### Goal
Analyze NFL quarterback performance using passing yards, weekly trends, and projections.

### Data

### Process
- Imported data from multiple separate CSV files: QB Season stats, QB Weekly stats (one file per week), and QB Weekly Projections(one file per week).
- Used a wildcard union in Tableau to combine weekly files efficiently.

- Built interactivity using filters + dashboard actions to sync views across multiple data sources.
